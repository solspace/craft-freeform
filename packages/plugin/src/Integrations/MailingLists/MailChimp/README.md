## Setup Guide

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview page](README.md). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have *Freeform Pro*. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

### Field Compatibility

Mailchimp integration includes support for field mapping to standard and custom fields of the following types:

* Text
* Website
* URL
* Dropdown
* Radio
* Date
* Zip
* Tags
  * To map *Contact Tags*, in the **Tags** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain Tag value(s). This could be a select dropdown, a checkbox group, radio field, hidden field, etc. When specifying multiples, separate by comma.
* Interests/Groups
  * To map a *Contact Interest/Group*, in the **Group or Interest** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain an Interest/Group name value(s). This could be a select dropdown, a checkbox group, radio field, hidden field, etc. This can only accept one value at this time, and it should be entered exactly as it is in Mailchimp, e.g. `My Group Name`.
* GDPR consent / Marketing settings
  * To map *GDPR consent / Marketing settings* options, in the **GDPR** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select the Freeform field(s) which will represent opting into the corresponding options. ANY value included in these will be considered an opt in (regardless of whether it's `yes` or `y`, etc). You will need to map a field to each GDPR setting individually, so you'll likely need to use a seperate checkbox field for each.
