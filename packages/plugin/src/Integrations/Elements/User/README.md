# Setup Guide
This integration allows you to map Freeform submission data to [Craft User](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/users.html), essentially creating a powerful [User Registration form](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/freeform/v5/guides/user-registration-forms/).

<span class="note warning"><b>Important:</b> This feature requires a <b>Craft Pro</b> license in order to work, as Users are a Craft Pro feature.</span>

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Integration

- Select *User* from the **Service Provider** select dropdown.
- Enter a name and handle for the integration. e.g. `My User Integration`.
- Set the defaults for the next 3 settings (these can be changed when configuring in the form builder later):
    - Choose a user group from the **User Group** select dropdown.
    - Toggle whether the user account should be **Active** or not.
    - Toggle whether to **Send an Activation Email** to the user or not.
- Click the **Save** button.

### 2. Configure the Form

- Open up the form inside the form builder.
- Click on the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on your new **User** integration in the list of available integrations.
- On the right side of the page:
    - Enable the integration.
    - Confirm the user group in the **User Group** field, or change it as necessary.
        <span class="note danger"><b>CAUTION:</b> All user groups, including ones with access to control panel will show here. Use extreme caution if allowing users to self-register for accounts that can access the Craft control panel!</span>
    - Toggle whether the user account should be **Activated** or not.
        - If you'd like new users to not yet be activated and receive the Craft User Activation email, toggle the **Activate Users** setting ON. If you'd like to manually approve registrations and suppress the email notification to users, toggle the **Send Activation Email** setting OFF.
    - Toggle whether to **Send an Activation Email** to the user or not.
        <span class="note danger"><b>CAUTION:</b> When using a manual Admin approving approach, it's still possible for a <b>Pending</b> user to circumvent this process if a <a href="https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/front-end-user-accounts#reset-password-forms">Forgot Password</a> form is available to them, as Craft currently does not have a concept of Admin approval only, and allows users to verify their account either through an email notification or using a <i>Forgot Password</i> form.</span>
    - The **Attribute Mapping** table allows you to map standard Craft User fields.
        - You will need to use the special [Password](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/freeform/v5/forms/fields/#password) field for mapping passwords to User passwords. The Freeform **Password** field will NOT save any password data in the Freeform database tables. It is designed specifically for this purpose.
    - The **Field Mapping** table is where you map Freeform fields to the Craft User fields as needed.

See [Mapping Guidelines](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/freeform/v5/integrations/elements/#mapping-guidelines) for more info.
