For sites that have already upgraded to 3.12.0 - 3.12.3, we recommend switching the Freeform Session Context setting to "Encrypted Payload" instead of "PHP Sessions" and carefully reviewing your forms.

If this is the case, you can switch the behavior back to previous approaches ('As Files' introduced in 3.10 or 'Inline' as it worked previously before 3.10+). This is a new setting available in the General Settings of Freeform or with Project Config as `scriptInsertType: files`.
