## 5.3.0 - 2024-05-24

### Changed
- Improved the Script Insert feature:
    The _Static URLs_ option is no longer available, and the default is now Craft's _Asset Bundles_ (an improved version of _As Files_). This ensures the best performance and reliability for any site and compatibility with Craft Cloud.
    - The file pointers endpoints (_Static URLs) remain available for backward compatibility.
    - The manual script loading approach (`loadFreeformPlugin`) will also automatically load Asset Bundle URLs.
    - Renamed the _Freeform Script Insertion Location_ and _Freeform Script Insert Type_ settings to _Script Insert Location_ and _Script Insert Type_, respectively.
- Updated the demo templates:
    - The submissions index view now orders submissions in descending order.
    - The submission view now includes an enhanced display of assets for _File Drag & Drop_ fields (in addition to regular File fields).
- Various updates to sample formatting templates:
    - No longer include vague CSS classes to avoid conflict with other site styles. Added `freeform-form` class to the `<form>` tag for all sample templates.
    - No longer force overrides for `addButtonLabel` and `removeButtonLabel` on Table fields.
    - Improved display and positioning of submit buttons on _Basic_ sample templates.
    - Improved display of success and error banners on _Basic_ sample templates.

## 5.2.0 - 2024-05-15

    - If you'd like to apply this change retroactively, you should run the `./craft freeform/submissions/resave` CLI command after enabling this setting.

## 4.0.0 - 2022-08-05

> [!WARNING]
> This is a larger and more complex update than usual, and there's a higher chance of a failed update attempt happening. Please ensure you have a recent database backup, and we recommend you test the update on a local/staging environment before updating your production server. Please follow the [Upgrading from Freeform 3.x guide](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/freeform/v4/setup/updating-freeform-3.html).

### Added
- Added compatibility with Craft 4.x.
- Added Export Email Notifications feature. Allows you to send exports as email notifications automatically.
- Added more information to email notification error logging. It now includes the email notification approach and the Email field name (if applicable) to track down where the issue is coming from.
- Added setting to have CSV exports use field handles for headings instead of field labels.
- Added support for permanently deleting soft-deleted submissions.
- Added `data-skip-html-reload` form attribute option to bypass HTML reload for AJAX forms (when not using render method).
- Added `EVENT_GET_CUSTOM_PROPERTY` developer event, which lets you inject your own properties on forms to expand their application.
- Added `EVENT_CONFIGURE_CORS` developer event, which lets you modify the CORS headers that will be sent with the request.
- Added a check in the diagnostics, install welcome screen, and settings pages to alert users if the "Freeform Script Insert Type" setting will not work as Static URLs (and needs to be switched to Files).
- Added the ability to map Mailchimp Interests to a form field. Limited to finding and passing a single Interest based on first match within Interest names part of a List.
- Added support for date fields in the Campaign Monitor integration.

### Changed
- Changed all existing forms with the **Success Behavior** setting set to _No Effect_ to now be _Reload Form with Success Message_. This will behave somewhat similarly to old behavior, but will no longer automatically redirect to a different URL upon success. Please review all forms and set the desired behavior for each in the **Success Behavior** setting. If you wish to continue to override the behavior at template level, you can do that as well.
- Changed all sample formatting templates to include a library version number on them and also end with the `.twig` extension (e.g. `foundation.html` is now `foundation-6.twig`). Freeform 4 will automatically migrate all existing forms using sample formatting templates to use the new file names. You shouldn't need to change anything. Where this might become an issue is if you are using the `formattingTemplate: 'template-name.html'` parameter at template level and relying on an older version of the sample template name.
- Changed all sample formatting templates use `|t('freeform')` only (instead of a mix of `|t` and `|t('freeform')`). If you're using static translations on sample formatting templates, you'll need to move `site.php` translations over to `freeform.php`.
- Changed the rendering of single checkboxes to now use the value set inside the form builder. No action should be necessary here. If you have a custom module in place to override this behavior, you can likely undo that now.
- Changed Email fields to no longer store data as an array. The migration will comb through your database and convert all values of Email field types (e.g. `["test@x.x"]` will become `test@x.x`). If you were relying on this feature to collect more than one email address, only the first email address will be kept (e.g. `["a@x.x","b@x.x"]` will become `a@x.x`). No action is necessary here, but if you relied on this functionality, it is a breaking change with no alternative option currently (aside from adding multiple **Email** fields to your forms, one for each email address). If you have a custom module that is working around this in any way, you should be able to disable it now.
- Updated newly created email notification templates' "From" email address and name to default to the newer way (via Project Config), e.g. `craft.app.projectConfig.get('email.fromEmail')`). If you are using the older approach in existing email notification templates, be sure to update them.
- Changed the way form submission data is stored. A new table for each form is now created and updated rather than storing all forms' submission data in a single shared database table. This solves several issues, including running out of fields and paves the way for more exciting future improvements to the form builder. Fields are still global and available to every form. No action should be necessary by the admin, as Freeform includes a migration script that automatically converts the data to be split into multiple database tables. This process may take a little longer if you have a very large site.
- All Freeform fields are now stored as the `TEXT` MySQL type instead of a combination of `TEXT`, `VARCHAR(100)` and `VARCHAR(255)`. This is a change that is applied to all existing fields as well since they are recreated in the migration. No action should be necessary here. In the rare case where your site has some kind of customization that relies on a MySQL type other than `TEXT`, you may have to adjust the database manually.
- Updated Dashboard, Forms listing and Survey & Polls dashboard to hide forms for users that do not have any form or submission access permissions to them.
- Switched over CP scripts to use local copies of external scripts.
- Upgraded the GraphQL interface calls to use the new Craft GraphQL API.
- Updated the "Use Return URL" success behavior to skip reloading the form (briefly) when using AJAX.
- Updated the sample formatting templates to include `ff-fieldtype-FIELDTYPE` classes to field-surrounding divs.
- Updated `league/flysystem`, `symfony/property-access`, `symfony/finder` and `symfony/filesystem` dependency version requirements to resolve some conflicts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Freeform 3.12+ introduces additional Form Session Context options for processing forms. For sites that have already upgraded to 3.12.0 - 3.12.3, we recommend switching the Freeform Session Context setting to "Encrypted Payload" instead of "PHP Sessions" and carefully reviewing your forms. If you prefer to continue using PHP Sessions and are caching your forms, you will need to add `{% do form.registerContext %}` below your form when loading the form in a cached template.

### Changed

- Fixed a bug where some of the Welcome install wizard's new 3.12 settings weren't saving correctly.

## 3.12.0 - 2021-11-10

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Freeform 3.12+ introduces additional Form Session Context options for processing forms. The default Form Session Context will be switched to "Encrypted Payload" instead of "PHP Sessions" upon upgrade. If you prefer to continue to use PHP Sessions and are caching your forms, you will need to add `{% do form.registerContext %}` below your form when loading the form in a cached template.

### Added
- Added a Drag & Drop File Upload field type (Pro).
- Added "Save & Continue Later" feature, which allows users to save their form progress and return later to complete the form.
- Added self-diagnostics page to help troubleshoot issues and identify potential issues.
- Added a Bootstrap 5 example formatting template.
- Added 'Extras' section to demo template to show additional common uses with forms.
- Added the ability to limit how many submissions a form can have.
- Added a setting to automatically scroll to the top of the Form on AJAX submits. This is especially beneficial when you have longer forms and success/error messages at the top of the form become out of sight.
- Added ability to disable the Freeform Honeypot per form at template level.
- Added ability to set payload forwarding to form render params.
- Added support for blocking phrases in spam keyword blocking feature (e.g. "generate new leads").

- Updated sample formatting templates to account for "Save & Continue Later" buttons.
- Updated the custom formatting templates and email notification templates lists to be ordered alphabetically in the form builder.
- Updated field option values to automatically appear as camelCase instead of an exact clone of what is typed as field option label.
- Updated newly created Text, Hidden, Invisible, Phone, Regex, and Website field types from `VARCHAR` to `TEXT` in database. Changed all other newly created field types to be `VARCHAR(255)` instead of `VARCHAR(100)`. This is not a retroactive change - it will affect the creation of new fields only.
- Updated the CP Field Manager page to sort fields alphabetically.
- Updated to the Honeypot field to include `autocomplete="off"`.
- Updated the `submitClass` parameter to control styling of "Save & Continue Later" buttons in addition to regular Submit buttons.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Freeform 3.11+ introduces changes to how its front-end scripts are inserted into pages (as static URLs). If you have server rules applied to JS and CSS files, you may run into issues. If this is the case, you can switch the behavior back to previous approaches ('As Files' introduced in 3.10 or 'Inline' as it worked previously before 3.10+).
